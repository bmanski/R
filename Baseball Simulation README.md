In Major League Baseball, there are two divisions, the National League and the American League. The American League allows another player to hit for the pitcher. This player is known as the designated hitter. However, in the National League, the pitcher must bat. Historically, the pitcher bats ninth, as they would have fewer plate appearances in a game on average. This paper will show how a simulated baseball game can determine where the pitcher should bat in the batting order to learn if the pitcher batting ninth is the optimal position.
